# Discord-Sneaker-Scraper

requirements:
discord.py 2.0 by rapptz -> look this up on Github and install the lib.
for quick install: pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py.git


You can scrape stock data from a few sites with this discord bot. There are also a few other tools that might help like a price calc for stockx.... . 
SOME OF THE SITES DONT WORK ANYMORE! This is because the code is already over a year old, so is the structure. I started this project, when I was reselling sneakers but that business is just not relevant anymore to me. Also I wrote this code when I was getting started with coding, so don't expect good code structur.

But maybe this code helps some people to get started.

Here are the sites that work/don't work
